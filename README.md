# A-Whale-Off-the-Port-folio

This repository concentrates on Portfolio Analysis and comparison between different portflios.

## Objective: 

The main objective of this project is to successfully:
  1. Read in and Wrangle Returns Data
  2. Determine Success of Each Portfolio
  3. Choose and Evaluate a Custom Portfolio

## Methods and Techniques Used:

The methods used for this project mainly focuses on reading, manipulating and organizing dataframes using Pandas.
This project demonstrates the ability of using the built in Pandas functions to compute statistical information (such as standard deviation and sharpe ratio) and be able to understand and compare the data in different manners, such as plotting the data. I have conducted Quantitative Analysis to calculate and visualize performance and risk metrics for the portfolios.
I have performed Risk Analysis to determine the risk of each portfolio by creating a box plot for each portfolio, calculating the standard deviation for all portfolios,
determining which portfolios are riskier than the S&P TSX 60 through the use of standard deviation, and lastly, calculated the Annualized Standard Deviation.
I have used the daily returns to calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot

Lastly I built my own portfolio of stocks, calculated the returns, and compare the results to the Whale Portfolios and the S&P TSX 60.
For doing that I chose 3-5 custom stocks with at least 1 year's worth of historic prices and create a DataFrame of the closing prices and dates for each stock. Calculation of the weighted returns for the portfolio assuming an equal number of shares for each stock has been done.
Later, I have joined my portfolio returns to the DataFrame that contains all of the portfolio returns for a better comparison. Then I had to re-run the performance and risk analysis with your portfolio to see how it compares to the others.
Finally, I have included the correlation analysis to determine which stocks are correlated.

## The Goal of This Project: 

The goal of this project is to be able to help determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. It also gives us an opportunity to take a look at how to build our own portfolios and compare its performance so that we can not only build our portfolio from the scratch but also understand how logical this investment is going to be.
